                <li class = "sectionol">Using this algorithm, the smart phones can automatically predict the perceptual quality of the received/corrupted video without referring to the original/uncorrupted video at the video server. The smart phone thus can request necessary but not excessive transmission resources (e.g. power or bandwidth) from the service provider to achieve great perceptual video quality for users. </li>
